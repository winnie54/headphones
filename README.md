Important notes with Figma:

if your computer doesn’t have missing fonts, you can find them here: source-sans-pro and Spin-Cycle-OT
some values are in float - feel free to round them
For this task, please write an amazing README.md

Interactions note:

1. the web page must switch to the mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less
2. links hover/active: #FF6565
3. button hover/active: opacity: 0.9
4. max width of the content: 1000px centered in the page
